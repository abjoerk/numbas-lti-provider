They provide a basic free service which is a good option if you want to test the Numbas LTI tool for compatibility with your learning environment.

To use Heroku, you must create an account.
Click on the button below to create your own instance of the Numbas LTI tool provider on Heroku's free service.

   :target: https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/numbas/numbas-lti-provider/tree/heroku

You'll be prompted to create an account, if necessary, and then click :guilabel:`Deploy app`.
Once the app is deployed, it's ready to use: click the :guilabel:`View` button to begin the web-based setup.

This service is unlikely to be adequate for use with large numbers of students.
Heroku offers a paid service which can scale up to meet demand, but make sure to check its costs and terms carefully.
